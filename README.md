# Towers_Of_Hanoi
Welcome to the Towers of Hanoi program in Java!

This program simulates the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle, where you are given three pegs and a stack of disks of different sizes. The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from the first peg to the third peg, while obeying the following rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a peg.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg.
To run the program, follow these steps:

Compile the program by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

javac TowersOfHanoi.java

Once the program is compiled, run the program by running the following command:

java TowersOfHanoi

You will be prompted to enter the number of disks you want to use for the puzzle. Enter a positive integer and press Enter.

The program will then display the solution to the puzzle, showing each move required to move all the disks from the first peg to the third peg.

After the puzzle is solved, the program will display the total number of moves required to solve the puzzle.
